                    <p>And if I changed my hair and the way that I talk
                        And if I got new friends and I cut my mustache off
                        And I knew what to say when the conversation died
                        And I gave better compliments than "You look really nice"
                        And if I had more fans and if I made more cash
                        And I believed you when you'd say I look nice
                        And if I changed everything
                        Yeah, my whole fucking life
                        Would you please love me then?
                        Would you please love me then?
                        Would you please love me?
                        Please love me
                        Please love me
                        Please love me
                        Please love me
                        And if I got to see a therapist on time
                        Maybe I could write a message on first try
                        But I waste a whole day choosing "Hey" or "Hi" or
                        "How you've been?" or "Is your day alright?"
                        And if I could stop with hypotheticals
                        Then this wouldn't be a hypothetical
                        But it is, and I can't, huh
                        Truthfully
                        I'm tired of being me
                        It's just too exhausting
                        I'm such a crybaby
                        And tragically
                        There are no real problems
                        Now I have to create them
                        So there is a purpose to my worrying
                        I spent some time in the promised land
                        And I spent my love on those who didn't love me back
                        And you waited here but not for me
                        You were waiting just 'cause you felt like it
                        And I'm so confused
                        What is happening?
                        Are you staying here or are you leaving?
                        Say something
                        Say that you love me
                        Truthfully
                        I'm tired of being me
                        It's just too exhausting
                        I'm such a crybaby
                        And tragically
                        There are no real problems
                        Now I have to create them
                        So there is a purpose to my worrying
                        It's eight o'clock and I just pressed "Send"
                        Now my text became some meaningless
                        Binary code, just some 1's and 0's
                        Until you gave it a meaning again
                        Truthfully
                        I'm tired of being me
                        It's just too exhausting
                        I'm such a crybaby
                        Tragically
                        There are no real problems
                        So I have to create them
                        So there is a purpose to my worrying
                        to my worrying
                        (A purpose to my worrying) to my worrying, yeah
                        (A purpose to my worrying) to my worrying
                        (A purpose to my worrying) to my worrying
